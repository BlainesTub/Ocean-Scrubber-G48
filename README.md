# Ocean-Scrubber-G48
This was the repository for the ENGR-120 Design Project, to create an autonomous robot that would simulate cleaning of an underwater sensor array.
The robot was built using a VEX kit, programmed in ROBOT C.
A final report with images of the Ocean Scrubber, along with two other robots from different groups has been included in the root directory as a .docx file.
